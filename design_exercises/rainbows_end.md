# Rainbows End

__This exercise presumes you've read the book Rainbows End.__

This exercise covers two days. 

On the first day, do the following:

1. Break into groups of 2-3 people.
2. Pick one chapter from Rainbows End and list and briefly describe 20 technologies from the chapter that don't exist today. 
3. With your group, discuss one of technologies you listed above. Specifically, consider the following:
	- Implications for society such as security, privacy, social interaction
	- Foundational technologies that you would assume have to exist before yours could come into existence. 
	- Possible architectural choices for implementing the technology on a world-wide basis. 
	- Scaling and reliability issues related to the technology (e.g. how could scaling be achieved, what are the ramifications of reliability problems)
4. Prepare a Powerpoint deck with exactly five slides:
	- Title and team members
	- Chapter selected and technology list
	- Technology description
	- Social ramifications
	- Architecture and other issues. 
5. Mail your Powerpoint deck to the TA NLT 4pm on the day before the second day of the exercise. The TA will assemble them into a single deck. 

In your discussions, feel free to reference sections in the book that support your ideas. Where the book is not specific enough make assumptions and support them. 

__Lightening presentations:__ On the second day, your designated spokesman will have exactly 5 minutes to present your 4 slides to the class.  We will go fast. 

## Example Technologies

* SHE
* Augmented reality
* Self-driving cars
* Virtual meetings that feel real
* Gesture-based UI
* Ubiquitously connected devices
* Rabbit (if you dare)

You're free to pick something else that caught your attention or to deal with only a piece of the technologies listed above. For example, augmented reality could be broken into several smaller pieces that may be more manageable.
