# Course Objectives

Students who successfully complete CS462 will understand the following concepts:

- Principles and concepts of designing and building distributed systems.
- Introduction to architectures for distributed computation including map-reduce, client-server, peer to peer, and event-driven.
- Cloud computing and APIs.
- Reliability, availability, and scalability of large applications.


# Learning Outcomes

### Computational Practice

- Students can implement significant programming projects that display knowledge of a variety of distributed system architectural styles.
- Students will analyze problems, determine solutions within the architectural style, and successfully implement those solutions.
- Students will program both individually and as part of a team.
- Students will use cloud-based systems to run and implement assignments
- Students will manage a cloud-based Web server and properly configure it.

### Computational Theory

Students will understand the proper use of distributed and decentralized algorithms including

- RESTful APIs
- Hierarchical vs heterarchical system architectures
- MapReduce
- Distributed Hash Tables
- Event-driven system
- Peer-to-peer architectures including Paxos, gossip protocols, and blockchain

Students will understand theoretical concepts and limitations of distributed systems including

- network practicalities such as latency, bandwidth, topology, cost, heterogeneity, security
- CAP theorem
- distributed transactions
- serialization
- identity and naming
- cryptography
- simultaneity

### Critical Thinking and Communication

Students will interact with peers in meaningful discussion, lead discussions in peer groups, prepare written reports, and make oral presentations.  
	
### Ethics and Computing

Students will be presented with societal outcomes of technological choices in distributed and decentralized systems, analyze those outcomes, explore possible alternatives from different choices, and present their findings in small groups.
